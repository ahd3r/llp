#         People.count_of_hand += 1

# p1 = People(name='Ben')
# # did not see count_of_hand since it is a reference to class as well as methods
# print(p1.__dict__)  # make dictionary from property in this instance (in instance constructor)

# print(p1.alive)
# print(p1.count_of_hand)  # general property

# # the same if type:
# # People.die(p1)  # since when we create instance and call in it method it pass instance, in the calling method param, at the first place
# p1.die('Buy bitcoin',)  # still pass instance in the first param of calling method
# print(p1.__dict__)
# print(p1.alive)
# print(p1.age)
# # print(p1.name)  # arise an error, since dead people do not have name
# # print(p1.some)  # arise an error, since do not have this method

# p2 = People('Shone')

# # If we do it, its just create new property in instance upon general, but did not change general
# # So with p1 or p2 (instance or self) we make instance (local) prop, if want work with general have to use People (class)
# # Via p1 or p2 (instance) we can have access to general prop (read it) but manipulate with them have to through People (class)

# p2.count_of_hand += 2
# print(p2.count_of_hand)  # 7
# print(p1.count_of_hand)  # 3

# # When we use static in JS, we make those method or property available only from class, not from instance (but in Python you can get it from instance, but not change, only if in the method and through class, but this params still general for everyone)

# # Or we can have access to static method through __proto__ and constructor, since static method in constructor of class, and this constructor with all variable of prototype in __proto__ of instance
# # ==================================
# # function static_method(...args) {
# #     console.log('bbbb')
# # }
# # instance.__proto__.constructor.static_method = static_method
# # ==================================

# # Because instance in JS have access only to 'this' and prototype, but static method in constructor, so we do not overwrite prototype of class in this way, but we still have a link to static method through constructor, so performance of not overwriting prototype we do not get, since we overwriting constructor, and as I thought we have link only to prototype, and static method not in it, and so we do not overwrite object, to which all reference, but instance link to prototype and constructor, where static method, as well, so instead of overwriting prototype, we write constructor, it is not a performance, it is just a case
# # Static method allow us to store it only in one place, that's make it general for all instance created from this class
# # So what is this 'one' place? This is a constructor in the prototype, so in the instance of class we will have '__proto__'
# # Which will send to prototype of this class, and this prototype has constructor of this class and method for itself
# # And in this constructor we will have a static method and property
# # Also in the __proto__ also exist constructor besides methods, which is of the class, and inside it live static property
# # So that why we can say class.property and get answer, because we use object which returns class constructor, do not consuse it with constructor of the instance
# # Shortly constructor of the class is a static method and properties, and constructor of the instance is an invoked defined constructor of the class with your arguments, and those constructor which you define in class definition is all about how to create constructor of instance
# # And in the constructor exist all your ready to use property, to which you can have access, by - 'instance.property', and the same works for class - 'class.property'
# # Example:
# # class A{
# #     constructor (a) {
# #         this.a = a;
# #     }
# # }
# # const a = new A('b');
# # # Since in a exist constructor with 'a' key-value where value is 'b'
# # console.log(a.a); # 'b'
# # And so it works for class constructor
# # But for class constructor you do not need to specify how to create this constructor, it creates when you create a class, and you can only add to them some new properties, by static keyword

# # So the static method or property do not add any performance, it just create method and property in the way, that JS may not worry about with which properties (this) it has to execute a function (maybe brings some performance)
# # And if property make static, then property becomes general for all instance, but you can not take it from instance, but it related to them

# # When we create ordinary method, it pass in the prototype of class and then, when create instance of this class, it creates link to this prototype calling it __proto__
# # So we can create this method only one and use it when we need, but pass right property with which this method has to work (this), it handels in the js arch layer, when we call method from exact instance, it somehow takes its property and work with them inside method

# # In the Python, object works as in js, but instead of store static in constructor and another in prototype, Python store it in one place, in class definition
# print(People.__dict__)  # Show all method and property, to which instance reference
# print(dir(People))  # Show all method and property, to which instance reference and all manipulation with classes itself


# class Company:
#     level = 1  # general parameter

#     def __init__(self, name, special):
#         self.name = name
#         self.special = special

#     def is_tech_company(self):  # ordinary method
#         if self.special == 'phone' or self.special == 'tech':
#             return True
#         return False

#     @classmethod
#     def defineSpecialByName(cls, name):  # classmethod, it is like ordinary method, but instead of accept first argument as instance, it gets class, which allow you to create instance, or call eather staticmethod or classmethod
#         if name == 'Apple':
#             special = 'phone'  # scope allow you create variable in statement and use it in global scope

#     @staticmethod
#     def just_level_up():  # also you can call it from instance

# =====================================
# Actually in Python OOP all methods in class are "static" or "classes", since it can be call from class directly, but it force us to pass instance, class or nothing in param in this case, and decorators for class or static method handle a rise error, since Python want to have an instance in first param place
# In this way also work inheritance, when you write class.__init__(self, *args), inside __init__ you change self obj, and so you get changed self by another class
# But when in inheritance people write super().__init__(*args), I think we just create an instance, like class() (super()), and call from it method __init__, but ....

# In the Python do not exist private method, it is work in it by dial between programers, if method have double _ in the begining of the name in method, then do not use this method in public way
# If method has double _ in the begining and in the end of name, the this method is dunder, it means, this method call by system, and help it in it some build-in function like: repr() -> __repr__, dir() -> __dir__, dict() -> __dict__, iter() -> __iter__, next() -> __next__, str() -> __str__, len() -> __len__, ...
# Dunder method can be also called by 'with' keyword (__exit__ and __enter__) or while creating constructor (__init__)
# When you write '+' under the hood it call __add__ dunder method, and it requires to have on the both side variable with the same type

# As an alternative in JS, we just create new method, which call when we want to get exact info of instance, for example, when we want an representation of class, we just can create and call method for representation, like toRepresent, or if we want to conwert it to string, we create and call method toString or toJSON, which created in class, in Python it make in more elegant way, but not necessary, you can still make it in a way as in JS, unlike it cool that +-*/= call this dunder method, and you can reassign it, but it still not necessary, since you can create a separate method for it, and I think, this is what you will do

# import json

# class Foo():
#     def __init__(self, one_p: int, two_p: int):
#         self.one = one_p
#         self.two = two_p

#     def __add__(self, other):
#         return Foo(self.one + other.one, self.two + other.two)

#     def __repr__(self) -> str:  # __repr__ method has always return a string
#         return json.dumps(self.__dict__)

#     def __len__(self) -> int:
#         return 2

#     __str__ = __repr__

# foo1 = Foo(2, 3)
# foo2 = Foo(4, 11)
# print(foo1)
# foo3 = foo1 + foo2
# print(len(foo3))
# print(str(foo3))
# print(foo1 + foo2)  # __add__ and __repr__

# So after this dunders, I got why we need to pass 'self', even in __init__ method, because it calls from exact instance, for set 'self' (instance), since before calling __init__ it already create instance and assing to variable

# OOP Metaclasses

#     return self.xx + self.x

# def add_attr(self):
#     self.xx = 5

# # In Python exit several way to create a class: one with class keyword and the second one is though 'type' function
# # The 'type' function somehow can tell us a type of value, and create a class itself
# # So I think, 'type' function can define base object in app, and this is what class actually need and do by this 'type' function
# Test1 = type('Test1', (), {'x': 3, 'add_attr': add_attr, 'sum_it': add_getter})

# class Test2:
#     def __init__(self):
#         self.x = 3

# # Test1 and Test2 extremely equivalent as a class (but attr different), besides with class keyword IDE can show you hint

# t2 = Test2()
# print(t1.x)
# t1.add_attr()
# print(t1.xx)

# # Since geting type of Test2, which was created via class keyword, return <class 'type'>, then I believe under the hood class uses 'type' function

# (( Mistakes ))

# just describe a mistake, which you may do:

# 1. Call module name as existing one
# 2. Call variable name as existing one, which reassign functionality existing, since in Python do not exist constant variable
# 3. Do not pass in function default arguments, which is immutable, for example:

# # In the past it declare default value only once, and then set to variable link of created value, and use it as default link in memory to value, so that's why when we execute function twice with default value it works with the not defined value
# # But now it defines and not change, since it concatenates, that means not mutate entering list, I think it works so for immutable in Python
# def add_U(user, list_U=['Someone first']):
#     # do not mutate list
#     if isinstance(user, list):
#         return list_U + user
#     return list_U + [user]

#     # # mutate list
#     # if isinstance(user, list):
#     #     for u in user:
#     #         list_U.append(u)
#     # else:
#     #     list_U.append(user)
#     # return list_U

# users = ['Elon Mask', 'Bogdan Paranitsa', 'Bart Wood']
# print(add_U('Andrii Statsenko', users))
# print(add_U('Bill Gates'))
# print(add_U(['Every Masons', 'Illuminates']))


# # One more example with default args:
# var = 1

# def get_variable():
#     return var

# def increment_var(var=get_variable()):  # as you already know, 'var' defines only once, what means 'get_variable()' executes only once
#     var += 1
#     return var

# print(increment_var())  # var is 2
# var = 100
# print(increment_var())  # var is 2 again, but expect 101
# print(get_variable())  # 100
# print(increment_var())

# To fix that all, you just need to define variable in every execution of function, for this just define default args as None (as not required, and then in execution defines for them value)

# 4. zip, map, filter,reduce and so on returns a generator, that means if we iterator through them, it will not iterate again, his end value was achieved, so it is the end, now it will return void
# If you need a result of some of this function, just make it result = list(generator)

# 5. Using * in import, it is mistake because it may be hard to debag, since something can be overwrite
